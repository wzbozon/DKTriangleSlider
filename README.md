# DKTriangleSlider

iOS triangle shaped slider.

IBDesignable and IBInspectables are supported, you can setup a slider right in the Interface builder.
If you have any problems with it, try Editor / Refresh Views in XCode.

Constant value can be set.
You can change colors, sizes, min and max values, constant value.

I use this control with ReactiveCocoa.
Written in Objective C.

## Requirements

Tested on iOS 9 and higher. But probably it supports iOS 8 also.
