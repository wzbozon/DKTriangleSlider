# DKTriangleSlider
UIControl that is like UISlider, but has segmented triangle background.

Constant value can be set.

I use this control with ReactiveCocoa. 

IBDesignable and IBInspectables are supported, you can setup a slider right in the Interface builder.
If you have any problems with it, try Editor / Refresh Views in XCode.
